	\section{Introduction}
	Global warming, far from being a recent phenomenon, can be perceived from another
	point as a persisting dilemma that continues to impact both anthropogenic development
	and the natural ecosystem. The primary agent provoking global warming is
	attributed to the emissions of greenhouse gases. Empirical studies confirm that
	carbon dioxide holds the dubious distinction of being the most abundant greenhouse
	gas in the atmosphere, contributing a staggering 72\% to global warming.

	However, it is noteworthy to mention that China ranks as the preeminent
	emitter of carbon dioxide on a global scale, discharging in excess of 6 billion
	tonnes of carbon dioxide annually. Hence, addressing this crisis,
	intrinsically connected to the existential fate of mankind, became a priority for
	China. As a concrete commitment to this endeavor, President Xi Jinping, in
	September 2020, proclaimed China's aim to "reach a peak in CO2 emissions by
	2030 and accomplish carbon neutrality by 2060". The challenge of achieving
	carbon neutrality is multifarious, necessitating a holistic approach,
	encompassing policy, economy, culture, and technology. This paper opts to
	focus on the forecasting of carbon emissions, a crucial foundational element for
	strategic decision-making. Proficient predictions furnish invaluable data that
	bolsters informed decision-making. Conversely, if the prognosis proves
	inaccurate, ensuing plans may fall into the domain of impracticality.

	The stakeholders who stand most directly impacted by these emissions include governments,
	investors, and researchers. Government bodies, equipped with foresight into future
	carbon emissions, can effectuate more meaningful change in climate policy, emergency
	development, and global cooperation. Conversely, researchers and investors, informed
	by predictive results, can more effectively design mechanisms such as the
	Emissions Trading System, Carbon Pricing System, and related technologies. Consequently,
	the act of forecasting carbon emissions carries significant implications for
	subsequent research.

	Since the year 2011, endeavors have been made to utilize logistic equations in
	order to prognosticate China's carbon emissions. At present, the primary methodologies
	employed for the prediction of CO2 emissions can be categorized into three principal
	clusters, specifically, statistical analysis models, non-linear intelligent
	models, and grey prediction techniques. Statistical models offer ease of
	application, yet they necessitate the collection of ample historical data before
	the models can undergo training. Conversely, machine learning frequently outperforms
	in forecasting relative to conventional statistical methods.

	This study implements the Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach, presenting
	multiple advantages: Firstly, GNNs are capable of effectively modelling
	spatial and temporal correlations. Secondly, GNNs have the capacity to
	integrate additional contextual data, such as socio-economic and policy factors.
	Thirdly, GNNs can yield an interpretable model structure, thus enabling
	researchers to derive insights into the relationships between various factors
	and their subsequent impact on carbon emissions.

	At this juncture, GNNs have not been extensively explored in the context of predicting
	carbon emissions. Hence, future research should pivot its focus towards delving
	into the application of GNNs in carbon emissions forecasting. The unique
	benefits offered by GNNs should be leveraged to construct models that are both
	highly accurate and interpretable.

	\section{Data Description}
	Transitioning now to our research endeavor, the initial phase entailed data acquisition
	from CarbonMonitor CHINA, a repository that chronicles the carbon emission
	statistics for the past five years. We amassed more than 200 thousand data points
	spanning from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2022, systematically segregating
	the data into 31 distinct states and five sectors respectively.

	Subsequently, we performed a rudimentary data analysis, classified according to
	temporality, sector, and state. A review of the past four years reveals that
	carbon emissions peaked in the year 2021. Furthermore, a substantial variation
	in carbon emissions was discerned across different sectors. Additionally, the states
	of Hebei and Shandong emerged as the leading contributors to the nation's carbon
	emissions.

	\end{figure}

	\subsection{Template Styles}


	The primary parameter given to the ``\verb|acmart|'' document class is the {\itshape template style}
	which corresponds to the kind of publication or SIG publishing the work. This
	parameter is enclosed in square brackets and is a part of the
	{\verb|documentclass|} command: \begin{verbatim}
  \documentclass[STYLE]{acmart}
\end{verbatim}

	Journals use one of three template styles. All but three ACM journals use the {\verb|acmsmall|}
	template style:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item {\verb|acmsmall|}: The default journal template style.

		\item {\verb|acmlarge|}: Used by JOCCH and TAP.

		\item {\verb|acmtog|}: Used by TOG.
	\end{itemize}

	The majority of conference proceedings documentation will use the {\verb|acmconf|}
	template style.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item {\verb|acmconf|}: The default proceedings template style.

		\item {\verb|sigchi|}: Used for SIGCHI conference articles.

		\item {\verb|sigchi-a|}: Used for SIGCHI ``Extended Abstract'' articles.

		\item {\verb|sigplan|}: Used for SIGPLAN conference articles.
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Template Parameters}


	In addition to specifying the {\itshape template style} to be used in formatting
	your work, there are a number of {\itshape template parameters} which modify
	some part of the applied template style. A complete list of these parameters can
	be found in the {\itshape \LaTeX\ User's Guide.}

	Frequently-used parameters, or combinations of parameters, include:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item {\verb|anonymous,review|}: Suitable for a ``double-blind'' conference
			submission. Anonymizes the work and includes line numbers. Use with the
			\verb|\acmSubmissionID| command to print the submission's unique ID on
			each page of the work.

		\item {\verb|authorversion|}: Produces a version of the work suitable for
			posting by the author.

		\item {\verb|screen|}: Produces colored hyperlinks.
	\end{itemize}

	This document uses the following string as the first command in the source
	file: \begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[sigconf,authordraft]{acmart}
\end{verbatim}

	\section{Modifications}


	Modifying the template --- including but not limited to: adjusting margins,
	typeface sizes, line spacing, paragraph and list definitions, and the use of the
	\verb|\vspace| command to manually adjust the vertical spacing between elements
	of your work --- is not allowed.

	{\bfseries Your document will be returned to you for revision if modifications are discovered.}

	\section{Typefaces}


	The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class requires the use of the ``Libertine''
	typeface family. Your \TeX\ installation should include this set of packages.
	Please do not substitute other typefaces. The ``\verb|lmodern|'' and ``\verb|ltimes|''
	packages should not be used, as they will override the built-in typeface
	families.

	\section{Title Information}


	The title of your work should use capital letters appropriately -
	\url{https://capitalizemytitle.com/} has useful rules for capitalization. Use the
	{\verb|title|} command to define the title of your work. If your work has a
	subtitle, define it with the {\verb|subtitle|} command. Do not insert line
	breaks in your title.

	If your title is lengthy, you must define a short version to be used in the page
	headers, to prevent overlapping text. The \verb|title| command has a ``short title''
	parameter: \begin{verbatim}
  \title[short title]{full title}
\end{verbatim}

	\section{Authors and Affiliations}


	Each author must be defined separately for accurate metadata identification.
	Multiple authors may share one affiliation. Authors' names should not be
	abbreviated; use full first names wherever possible. Include authors' e-mail addresses
	whenever possible.

	Grouping authors' names or e-mail addresses, or providing an ``e-mail alias,''
	as shown below, is not acceptable:
	\begin{verbatim}
  \author{Brooke Aster, David Mehldau}
  \email{dave,judy,steve@university.edu}
  \email{firstname.lastname@phillips.org}
\end{verbatim}

	The \verb|authornote| and \verb|authornotemark| commands allow a note to apply
	to multiple authors --- for example, if the first two authors of an article
	contributed equally to the work.

	If your author list is lengthy, you must define a shortened version of the list
	of authors to be used in the page headers, to prevent overlapping text. The following
	command should be placed just after the last \verb|\author{}| definition:
	\begin{verbatim}
  \renewcommand{\shortauthors}{McCartney, et al.}
\end{verbatim}
	Omitting this command will force the use of a concatenated list of all of the
	authors' names, which may result in overlapping text in the page headers.

	The article template's documentation, available at \url{https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template},
	has a complete explanation of these commands and tips for their effective use.

	Note that authors' addresses are mandatory for journal articles.

	\section{Rights Information}


	Authors of any work published by ACM will need to complete a rights form.
	Depending on the kind of work, and the rights management choice made by the author,
	this may be copyright transfer, permission, license, or an OA (open access) agreement.

	Regardless of the rights management choice, the author will receive a copy of
	the completed rights form once it has been submitted. This form contains \LaTeX\ commands
	that must be copied into the source document. When the document source is
	compiled, these commands and their parameters add formatted text to several areas
	of the final document:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item the ``ACM Reference Format'' text on the first page.

		\item the ``rights management'' text on the first page.

		\item the conference information in the page header(s).
	\end{itemize}

	Rights information is unique to the work; if you are preparing several works
	for an event, make sure to use the correct set of commands with each of the works.

	The ACM Reference Format text is required for all articles over one page in length,
	and is optional for one-page articles (abstracts).

	\section{CCS Concepts and User-Defined Keywords}


	Two elements of the ``acmart'' document class provide powerful taxonomic tools
	for you to help readers find your work in an online search.

	The ACM Computing Classification System ---
	\url{https://www.acm.org/publications/class-2012} --- is a set of classifiers
	and concepts that describe the computing discipline. Authors can select entries
	from this classification system, via \url{https://dl.acm.org/ccs/ccs.cfm}, and
	generate the commands to be included in the \LaTeX\ source.

	User-defined keywords are a comma-separated list of words and phrases of the authors'
	choosing, providing a more flexible way of describing the research being presented.

	CCS concepts and user-defined keywords are required for for all articles over two
	pages in length, and are optional for one- and two-page articles (or abstracts).

	\section{Sectioning Commands}


	Your work should use standard \LaTeX\ sectioning commands: \verb|section|, \verb|subsection|,
	\verb|subsubsection|, and \verb|paragraph|. They should be numbered; do not remove
	the numbering from the commands.

	Simulating a sectioning command by setting the first word or words of a paragraph
	in boldface or italicized text is {\bfseries not allowed.}

	\section{Tables}


	The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class includes the ``\verb|booktabs|'' package
	--- \url{https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs} --- for preparing high-quality tables.

	Table captions are placed {\itshape above} the table.

	Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best placement for them is typically
	the top of the page nearest their initial cite. To ensure this proper ``floating''
	placement of tables, use the environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's
	contents and the table caption. The contents of the table itself must go in the
	\textbf{tabular} environment, to be aligned properly in rows and columns, with
	the desired horizontal and vertical rules. Again, detailed instructions on
	\textbf{tabular} material are found in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

	Immediately following this sentence is the point at which Table~\ref{tab:freq}
	is included in the input file; compare the placement of the table here with the
	table in the printed output of this document.

	\begin{table}
		\caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
		\label{tab:freq}
		\begin{tabular}{ccl}
			\toprule Non-English or Math & Frequency   & Comments          \\
			\midrule \O                  & 1 in 1,000  & For Swedish names \\
			$\pi$                        & 1 in 5      & Common in math    \\
			\$                           & 4 in 5      & Used in business  \\
			$\Psi^{2}_{1}$               & 1 in 40,000 & Unexplained usage \\
			\bottomrule
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}

	To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of the page's live area,
	use the environment \textbf{table*} to enclose the table's contents and the
	table caption. As with a single-column table, this wide table will ``float''
	to a location deemed more desirable. Immediately following this sentence is the
	point at which Table~\ref{tab:commands} is included in the input file; again, it
	is instructive to compare the placement of the table here with the table in the
	printed output of this document.

	\begin{table*}
		\caption{Some Typical Commands}
		\label{tab:commands}
		\begin{tabular}{ccl}
			\toprule Command                    & A Number & Comments         \\
			\midrule \texttt{{\char'134}author} & 100      & Author           \\
			\texttt{{\char'134}table}           & 300      & For tables       \\
			\texttt{{\char'134}table*}          & 400      & For wider tables \\
			\bottomrule
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table*}

	Always use midrule to separate table header rows from data rows, and use it only
	for this purpose. This enables assistive technologies to recognise table
	headers and support their users in navigating tables more easily.

	\section{Math Equations}
	You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles: inline,
	numbered or non-numbered display. Each of the three are discussed in the next sections.

	\subsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}
	A formula that appears in the running text is called an inline or in-text formula.
	It is produced by the \textbf{math} environment, which can be invoked with the
	usual \texttt{{\char'134}begin\,\ldots{\char'134}end} construction or with the
	short form \texttt{\$\,\ldots\$}. You can use any of the symbols and structures,
	from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in \LaTeX~\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this
	section will simply show a few examples of in-text equations in context. Notice
	how this equation:
	\begin{math}
		\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
	\end{math}, set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when set
	in display style. (See next section).

	\subsection{Display Equations}
	A numbered display equation---one set off by vertical space from the text and centered
	horizontally---is produced by the \textbf{equation} environment. An unnumbered
	display equation is produced by the \textbf{displaymath} environment.

	Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols and structures
	available in \LaTeX\@; this section will just give a couple of examples of
	display equations in context. First, consider the equation, shown as an inline
	equation above:
	\begin{equation}
		\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
	\end{equation}
	Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in the \textbf{displaymath} environment.
	Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:
	\begin{displaymath}
		\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x + 1
	\end{displaymath}
	and follow it with another numbered equation:
	\begin{equation}
		\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_{i}=\int_{0}^{\pi+2}f
	\end{equation}
	just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.

	\section{Figures}


	The ``\verb|figure|'' environment should be used for figures. One or more
	images can be placed within a figure. If your figure contains third-party material,
	you must clearly identify it as such, as shown in the example below.
	\begin{figure}[h]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{sample-franklin}
		\caption{1907 Franklin Model D roadster. Photograph by Harris \& Ewing, Inc. [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons. (\url{https://goo.gl/VLCRBB}).}
		\Description{A woman and a girl in white dresses sit in an open car.}
	\end{figure}

	Your figures should contain a caption which describes the figure to the reader.

	Figure captions are placed {\itshape below} the figure.

	Every figure should also have a figure description unless it is purely decorative.
	These descriptions convey what’s in the image to someone who cannot see it. They
	are also used by search engine crawlers for indexing images, and when images
	cannot be loaded.

	A figure description must be unformatted plain text less than 2000 characters
	long (including spaces). {\bfseries Figure descriptions should not repeat the figure caption – their purpose is to capture important information that is not already provided in the caption or the main text of the paper.}
	For figures that convey important and complex new information, a short text
	description may not be adequate. More complex alternative descriptions can be placed
	in an appendix and referenced in a short figure description. For example, provide
	a data table capturing the information in a bar chart, or a structured list
	representing a graph. For additional information regarding how best to write figure
	descriptions and why doing this is so important, please see
	\url{https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/describing-figures/}.

	\subsection{The ``Teaser Figure''}


	A ``teaser figure'' is an image, or set of images in one figure, that are
	placed after all author and affiliation information, and before the body of the
	article, spanning the page. If you wish to have such a figure in your article,
	place the command immediately before the \verb|\maketitle| command: \begin{verbatim}
  \begin{teaserfigure}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sampleteaser}
    \caption{figure caption}
    \Description{figure description}
  \end{teaserfigure}
\end{verbatim}

	\section{Experiment}


	In this section, we present the experiment of these three models, AGCRN, MLP and
	FC-LSTM.

	\subsection{Evaluation Metrics }
	To compare the model performance, we implement MAE, MAPE and RMSE to measure these
	three models.

	\emph{MAE:} MAE measures the average absolute difference between the predicted
	and actual carbon emissions. It evaluates the model's ability to make accurate
	predictions.
	\[
		MAE(y, \hat{y}) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}|y_{i}- \hat{y}_{i}|
	\]
	\emph{MAPE:} MAPE measures the average absolute percentage difference between the
	predicted and actual carbon emissions. It is used to evaluate the accuracy of
	the model's predictions relative to the actual values.
	\[
		MAPE(y, \hat{y}) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{||y_{i}- \hat{y}_{i}||}{||y_{i}||}
	\]

	\emph{RMSE:} RMSE is the square root of the MSE and is used to measure the
	standard deviation of the errors made by the model.
	\[
		RMSE(y, \hat{y}) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_{i}- \hat{y}_{i})^{2}}
	\]
	\subsection{Simulation Results}
	In the simulation section, the parameter settings are listed in Table. \ref{Parameter
	settings
	}, we split the datasets into 70\% training data, 15\% validation data and 15\%
	test data.

	\begin{table}
		\caption{Parameter settings }
		\label{Parameter settings }
		\begin{tabular}{cl}
			\toprule Parameter/Setting    & Value  \\
			\midrule Tp                   & 1d     \\
			Tr                            & 10d    \\
			Loss function                 & L2Loss \\
			Optimizer                     & Adam   \\
			Percentage of training data   & 70\%   \\
			Percentage of validation data & 15\%   \\
			Percentage of test data       & 15\%   \\
			Epochs                        & 100    \\
			Number of runs                & 1      \\
			\bottomrule
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}

	In Table. \ref{Average performance}, we exhibit the average performance comparison
	of different approaches. As you can see, the AGCRN performs the best in the three
	methods. MAE is 0.0151, MAPE is 2.7\% and RMSE is 0.0263.

	\begin{table}
		\caption{Average performance comparison of different approaches.}

		\begin{tabular}{cccl}
			\toprule Method & MAE      & MAPE      & RMSE     \\
			\midrule AGCRN  & $0.0151$ & $2.7\%$   & $0.0263$ \\
			MLP             & $0.0699$ & $8.8\%$   & $0.1010$ \\

	\end{table}

	The AGCRN model outperformed the MLP and FC-LSTM models in our experiment,
	primarily due to its ability to capture the complex spatiotemporal
	dependencies of carbon emissions. The graph-based convolutional neural network
	structure of the AGCRN model enables it to extract features from the spatial and
	temporal domains simultaneously, resulting in more accurate predictions. In contrast,
	the MLP and FC-LSTM models are traditional machine learning models that rely
	on linear regression and LSTM networks, respectively, to forecast carbon
	emissions.

	\subsection{Performance Evaluation }
	In the experiment, we also visualize the prediction result and evaluate the performance,
	as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:AGCRN} and Fig. \ref{fig:MLP}.

	\begin{figure}[h]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/MLP.png}
		\caption{MLP.}
		\label{fig:MLP}
	\end{figure}

	From these two pictures of Guangdong carbon emission prediction, we can apparently
	find that the AGCRN has better prediction results than MLP, which further
	proves that the AGCRN method is more suitable for carbon emission prediction.

	In conclusion, the AGCRN model's superior performance in predicting carbon emissions
	can be attributed to its unique graph-based convolutional neural network structure,
	which allows it to capture the intricate spatiotemporal dependencies of carbon
	emissions. This study's findings offer valuable insights into the development of
	more accurate and effective models for predicting carbon emissions, which can
	inform policymakers and stakeholders in their efforts to reduce carbon
	emissions and mitigate climate change.

	\section{Conclusion and Future Work}


	In this course project, we presented three models, AGCRN, MLP, and FC-LSTM, for
	predicting the daily carbon emissions of 31 Chinese provinces using historical
	data from January 1st, 2019 to December 31st, 2022. Our results demonstrated that
	the AGCRN model outperformed the MLP and FC-LSTM models, indicating its
	robustness in predicting carbon emissions accurately.

	The findings of this project offer a new approach to enhance the precision of
	carbon emission prediction. The AGCRN model's superior performance can be attributed
	to its ability to capture the complex spatial and temporal dependencies of carbon
	emissions. Our study provides valuable insights into the development of more
	accurate and effective models for predicting carbon emissions, which can inform
	policymakers and stakeholders in their efforts to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate
	climate change.

	\emph{Future work:} This project model can help carbon market stakeholders grasp
	the future trend of the carbon market more accurately and provide a reference for
	policymakers and investors in decision-making. However, the quality and availability
	of the carbon emission data are low, which makes it hard to improve the
	accuracy rapidly.

	In future work, we can consider more factors to improve the accuracy of carbon
	emission prediction such as weather, seasonality, and economic conditions.
	What’s more, it is necessary to improve the computational complexity.

	\section{Citations and Bibliographies}


	The use of \BibTeX\ for the preparation and formatting of one's references is strongly
	recommended. Authors' names should be complete --- use full first names (``Donald
	E. Knuth'') not initials (``D. E. Knuth'') --- and the salient identifying
	features of a reference should be included: title, year, volume, number, pages,
	article DOI, etc.

	The bibliography is included in your source document with these two commands,
	placed just before the \verb|\end{document}| command: \begin{verbatim}
  \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
  \bibliography{bibfile}
\end{verbatim}
	where ``\verb|bibfile|'' is the name, without the ``\verb|.bib|'' suffix, of the
	\BibTeX\ file.

	Citations and references are numbered by default. A small number of ACM
	publications have citations and references formatted in the ``author year''
	style; for these exceptions, please include this command in the
	{\bfseries preamble} (before the command ``\verb|\begin{document}|'') of your
	\LaTeX\ source: \begin{verbatim}
  \citestyle{acmauthoryear}
\end{verbatim}

	Some examples. A paginated journal article \cite{Abril07}, an enumerated
	journal article \cite{Cohen07}, a reference to an entire issue \cite{JCohen96},
	a monograph (whole book) \cite{Kosiur01}, a monograph/whole book in a series (see
	2a in spec. document) \cite{Harel79}, a divisible-book such as an anthology or
	compilation \cite{Editor00} followed by the same example, however we only
	output the series if the volume number is given \cite{Editor00a} (so Editor00a's
	series should NOT be present since it has no vol. no.), a chapter in a divisible
	book \cite{Spector90}, a chapter in a divisible book in a series

	\section{Acknowledgments}


	Identification of funding sources and other support, and thanks to individuals
	and groups that assisted in the research and the preparation of the work should
	be included in an acknowledgment section, which is placed just before the
	reference section in your document.

	This section has a special environment: \begin{verbatim}
  \begin{acks}
  ...
  \end{acks}
\end{verbatim}
	so that the information contained therein can be more easily collected during the
	article metadata extraction phase, and to ensure consistency in the spelling
	of the section heading.

	Authors should not prepare this section as a numbered or unnumbered
	{\verb|\section|}; please use the ``{\verb|acks|}'' environment.

	\section{Appendices}


	If your work needs an appendix, add it before the ``\verb|\end{document}|''
	command at the conclusion of your source document.

	Start the appendix with the ``\verb|appendix|'' command: \begin{verbatim}
  \appendix
\end{verbatim}
	and note that in the appendix, sections are lettered, not numbered. This
	document has two appendices, demonstrating the section and subsection identification
	method.

	\section{Multi-language papers}


	Papers may be written in languages other than English or include titles,
	subtitles, keywords and abstracts in different languages (as a rule, a paper in
	a language other than English should include an English title and an English abstract).
	Use \verb|language=...| for every language used in the paper. The last
	language indicated is the main language of the paper. For example, a French
	paper with additional titles and abstracts in English and German may start
	with the following command
	\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[sigconf, language=english, language=german,
               language=french]{acmart}
\end{verbatim}

	The title, subtitle, keywords and abstract will be typeset in the main language
	of the paper. The commands \verb|\translatedXXX|, \verb|XXX| begin title,
	subtitle and keywords, can be used to set these elements in the other languages.
	The environment \verb|translatedabstract| is used to set the translation of
	the abstract. These commands and environment have a mandatory first argument:
	the language of the second argument. See \verb|sample-sigconf-i13n.tex| file for
	examples of their usage.

	\section{SIGCHI Extended Abstracts}


	The ``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template style (available only in \LaTeX\ and not in
	Word) produces a landscape-orientation formatted article, with a wide left
	margin. Three environments are available for use with the ``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template
	style, and produce formatted output in the margin:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item {\verb|sidebar|}: Place formatted text in the margin.

		\item {\verb|marginfigure|}: Place a figure in the margin.

		\item {\verb|margintable|}: Place a table in the margin.
	\end{itemize}
